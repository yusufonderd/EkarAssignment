## App Flow
#### MapFragment
App opens with map screen fragment and â€‹navigate to the home screen after showing the trendyol logo to the user for 2 seconds.

#### MapFragment
MapFragment is the main part of the app. In first launch, random markers are placed on the map around Dubai zone. Features is listed below:
* Different colored markers placed in map.
* Click marker to navigate vehicle screen.

#### VehicleFragment
This screen responsible for showing all details of vehicle such as price, standard seating, booking fee and the other things.

## Architecture
This app adopts Clean Architecture behaviour. Here is the package structure:

#### Core
It is the package that contains all the common and base classes used within the application. 
Extensions, deciders, utils and base classes are included in this package.

#### Data
Data package should include response models, data source and api methods. It shouldn't know any logic.

#### UI 
Ui like a feature. It contains Fragments, view models and feature related classes like a domains, mappers and ui models.
Make sure that all classes here are specific to the this feature. If it is a class that is also used in other features, it should be moved to the common package.

#### Di
This package may actually be inside the common module. But I prefer to carry outside of core package to be more visible. 

#### Ui-Component
In large projects, we need to use a view component in more than one place. So i moved common view components under ui-component package.
